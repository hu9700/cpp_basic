protected access of members
protected, is similar to private, but it can also be accessed in the inherited class:

Example:
1. class ABC : private XYZ              //private derivation
            {                }
2. class ABC : public XYZ              //public derivation
            {               }
3. class ABC : protected XYZ              //protected derivation
            {              }
4. class ABC: XYZ                            //private derivation by default
{            }
Note:

privately inherited
public members of the base class 
becomes the private members of the derived class 


publicly inherited
public members of the base class 
also become the public members of the derived class.
